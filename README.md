# The-Marginal-Impact-of-Winning-in-the-NCAA-March-Madness-Tournament-on-Admission

**Abstract:** The utility of success in college athletics is often debated by those who have an interest the broader success of institutions of higher education. While some believe that any dollar spent on athletics is a dollar not going towards investing in educational infrastructure, other hold that success in sports can be an effective mechanism for raising the national profile of a university. After adjusting winning based on a teams seeding in the NCAA's *March Madness* tournament and using a fixed-effects regression model, we can estimate the causal impact of post-season success in NCAA Division 1 basketball on the quantity of applications that a university receives. We find that success, conditional on expectations, is causally correlated with a 1% increase in the number of applications a schools admission office receives.
